# Runtime Testing and Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the runtime testing performed on the Diamond Anniversary application and all fixes applied to resolve identified issues.

## Testing Summary
Date: January 22, 2025
Application: Diamond Anniversary Design
Environment: Development (localhost:3000)

## Issues Identified and Fixes Applied

### 1. Deprecated Images Configuration Warning
**Issue**: Next.js was showing a deprecation warning for `images.domains` configuration
```
Warning: `images.domains` is deprecated. Please use `images.remotePatterns` configuration instead.
```

**Fix Applied**: Updated `next.config.mjs` to replace deprecated `images.domains` with `images.remotePatterns`
- **File Modified**: `next.config.mjs`
- **Change**: Replaced `domains` array with `remotePatterns` configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 2. Missing Fallback Authentication Passwords
**Issue**: Mock authentication system had empty passwords object, preventing fallback authentication when Supabase is unavailable

**Fix Applied**: Added fallback passwords for mock users in the authentication system
- **File Modified**: `lib/auth.ts`
- **Change**: Added passwords for `admin@balyabhavan.edu` and `rajesh.kumar@example.com` in the `passwords` object
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Functionality Testing Results

### ✅ Authentication System
- **Login API**: Working correctly (`/api/auth/login`)
- **Registration API**: Working correctly (`/api/auth/register`)
- **Session Management**: Proper authentication flow
- **Fallback Authentication**: Mock users can authenticate when Supabase is unavailable

### ✅ Admin Functionality
- **User Management**: Protected endpoints responding correctly with 403 for unauthorized access
- **Auth Stats**: Protected endpoint working as expected
- **Authorization**: Proper access control implemented

### ✅ Storage System
- **Supabase Connection**: Successfully connected
- **Storage Test**: Photos bucket accessible and functional
- **File Upload**: Storage system ready for file operations

### ✅ Event Management
- **Events Page**: Loading and displaying events correctly
- **Event Registration**: Registration forms functional
- **Event Data**: Static event data displaying properly

### ✅ Application Stability
- **Server Status**: Development server running stable on localhost:3000
- **Route Compilation**: All API routes compiling successfully
- **No Runtime Errors**: No critical runtime errors detected
- **Browser Loading**: Application loads without errors in browser

## Configuration Status

### Environment Variables
- JWT_SECRET: ✅ Configured
- Supabase URL: ✅ Configured
- Supabase Keys: ✅ Configured
- Connection Enabled: ✅ True
- API URL: ✅ Configured

### Database Connection
- Supabase: ✅ Connected and functional
- Fallback System: ✅ Mock data available

## Performance Notes
- Server restarts occasionally due to file changes (normal in development)
- All API endpoints responding within acceptable timeframes
- Image optimization configuration updated to modern standards

## Recommendations

1. **Production Deployment**: Ensure Supabase credentials are properly configured for production
2. **Security**: Remove or secure mock passwords before production deployment
3. **Monitoring**: Consider adding error logging for production environment
4. **Testing**: All core functionality tested and working correctly

## Conclusion
The Diamond Anniversary application has been thoroughly tested and all identified runtime issues have been resolved. The application is functioning correctly with:
- Stable authentication system with fallback support
